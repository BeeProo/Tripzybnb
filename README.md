## Role-Based Access

### 👤 Guest (User)
- Browse and search listings by location, price, rating, tags, amenities
- Book properties with **Razorpay** payment (auto-confirms on successful payment)
- View booking history and cancel upcoming trips
- **Wishlist** — save favorite properties (heart icon on cards + detail page)
- **Message hosts** directly from listing pages
- **Real-time notifications** — bell icon with unread badge for messages, booking updates
- Write reviews and rate stays
- Dark mode toggle

### 🏠 Host
- **Dedicated host portal** with separate login/registration (`/host/login`, `/host/register`)
- **Host Dashboard** — view all active listings with stats
- **Request new properties** — submit additional listings for admin approval
- **New Customers tab** — see all confirmed bookings across properties with guest details and payment status
- **Manage bookings** — confirm/reject pending bookings, cancel confirmed ones
- **Edit listings** — update title, description, price, images, amenities
- **View property details** — see bookings, reviews, and customer info per listing
- **Real-time notifications** — instant alerts for new bookings, cancellations, and messages
- Message guests

### 🛡️ Admin
- Full **Admin Panel** with platform-wide analytics
- Manage all users (view, delete with cascading data cleanup)
- Manage all listings (CRUD)
- **Approve/reject host requests** — hosts cannot create listings directly
- View all bookings across the platform
- **Preview dropdown** — switch between host and customer page views for reference
- Access to all listings via "All Listings" nav link

---

## Payment Integration (Razorpay)

Razorpay is integrated in **test mode** for sandbox transactions.

### How It Works
1. User selects dates on a listing → clicks **"Pay ₹X"**
2. Razorpay checkout popup opens with prefilled user details
3. User completes payment with test card
4. On success → booking is **auto-confirmed** with payment ID stored
5. Host sees the booking as "✅ Paid" in their dashboard

### Test Card Details
| Field  | Value              |
|--------|--------------------|
| Card   | `4111 1111 1111 1111` |
| Expiry | Any future date (e.g., `12/26`) |
| CVV    | Any 3 digits (e.g., `123`) |
| OTP    | `1234`             |

### Configuration
The Razorpay test key is configured in `client/src/pages/ListingDetail.jsx`:
```js
key: 'rzp_test_Sj0u9e8aOZK11V'
```
Replace with your own key from [Razorpay Dashboard](https://dashboard.razorpay.com/).

## Booking Flow

```
Guest selects dates → Clicks "Pay ₹X"
    ↓
Razorpay popup opens → Guest pays with test card
    ↓
Payment success → Booking auto-confirmed (status: "confirmed")
    ↓
Guest sees booking in Dashboard (✅ Paid + Confirmed)
Host receives 🔔 real-time notification: "New Booking!"
Host sees customer in "New Customers" tab (✅ Paid)
```

---

## Notification System

Real-time in-app notifications powered by **Socket.io** + **MongoDB**.

### Notification Triggers

| Event | Recipient | Icon | Description |
|-------|-----------|------|-------------|
| New message sent | Other participant | 💬 | "New message from {name}" with preview |
| New booking created | Property host | 🎉 | "{guest} booked {property} for ₹{amount}" |
| Booking cancelled by guest | Property host | ❌ | "{guest} cancelled their booking" |
| Booking cancelled by host | Guest | ❌ | "Your booking has been cancelled" |

### How It Works
1. User logs in → Socket.io connects and joins personal `user:{id}` room
2. Backend events trigger `createNotification()` → saves to DB + emits via Socket.io
3. Navbar bell icon shows pulsing red unread badge
4. Click bell → dropdown with latest 20 notifications
5. Click notification → marks as read + navigates to relevant page
6. "Mark all read" button clears all unread indicators
7. Notifications auto-expire after 30 days (MongoDB TTL index)
